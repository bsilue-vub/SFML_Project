## Description
This project sets forth a research report in the form of a Python Jupyter Notebook that addresses three research questions on the topic of Machine Learning. The research questions are:

1. _"Consider two classifier models, one being a neural network and the other being a variational neural network. How do these models compare in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample error on a poker dataset?"_ 
2. _"Do Specialized Models Outperform a General 'One Model Fits All' Approach in Predictive Analysis?"_ 
3. _"How does Bayesian Inference for model selection and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning impact performance and compare to traditional methods?"_ 

The code for the project can be found [here](code/main.ipynb). Each research question is also provided separately in its own folder inside the `code` directory.
