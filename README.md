## Description
This project sets forth a research report in the form of a Python Jupyter Notebook that addresses three research questions on the topic of Machine Learning. The research questions are:

1. _first research question_ 
2. _second research question_ 
3. _third research question_ 

The code for the project can be found [here](code/project.ipynb). Each research question is also provided separately in its own respective folder inside the `code` directory.
